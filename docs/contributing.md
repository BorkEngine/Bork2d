> **Status:** current. The warning/style/format/AOT gates and the docs link check are active.
> CI runs docs link check, build, tests, and format verification on PRs to `develop` and pushes to
> `develop`; the NativeAOT publish/run smoke is a required local gate.

## 1. Prerequisites

- .NET SDK pinned by `global.json` (`11.0.100-rc.1`, target `net11.0`).
- Windows for windowed/Vulkan work; headless builds/tests should stay cross-platform where
  practical.
- Vulkan 1.3 GPU/driver for windowed/offscreen checks from M6; SDL2 natives from M2.
- NativeAOT toolchain (MSVC) for the local publish gate.

## 2. Build, test, and local gates

```powershell
dotnet build src/Bork2d/Bork2d.slnx -c Debug
dotnet build src/Bork2d/Bork2d.slnx -c Release
dotnet test src/Bork2d/Bork2d.slnx -c Debug
dotnet format src/Bork2d/Bork2d.slnx --verify-no-changes --no-restore
pwsh scripts/check-docs.ps1
```

NativeAOT publish/run is required for runtime-affecting changes:

```powershell
dotnet publish src/Bork2d/Bork2d.AotSmoke/Bork2d.AotSmoke.csproj -c Release -r win-x64
& src/Bork2d/Bork2d.AotSmoke/bin/Release/net11.0/win-x64/publish/Bork2d.AotSmoke.exe
```

## 3. Build, style, and warnings

- `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`, `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild=true`, Microsoft/.NET-standard
  `.editorconfig`, enforced IDE rules as errors.
- AOT/trim analyzers as errors on runtime projects (`IsAotCompatible`, `EnableAotAnalyzer`,
  `EnableTrimAnalyzer`).
- `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` is a CI gate.
- Shared settings live in `Directory.Build.props` and the root `.editorconfig`; do not override
  them per project without a decision-log entry.
- Suppressions must be the narrowest `#pragma`/`[SuppressMessage]`, justified, and scoped. `NoWarn`
  is a review flag with an owner/expiry.

## 4. C# conventions

File-scoped namespaces; nullable enabled; explicit accessibility; `var` only when the type is
obvious; braces for control flow; one type per file; `_camelCase` private fields; `PascalCase`
constants; `I`-prefixed interfaces; `Async` suffix and no `async void` outside handlers; guard
clauses; no regions except generated code; no commented-out code; XML docs on public API.

Known gap: `IAssets`, `IWindow`, `IInput`, `ITime`, and most `Data.cs` members predate the XML-doc
rule and are undocumented. Add docs when those contracts are implemented (M2/M3); do not remove
the rule.

## 5. Architecture boundaries

- Game code references `Bork2d.Api`/`Bork2d.Runtime` only; implementation projects are internal.
- Editor/tooling stays JIT; no Avalonia, TOML, or reflection in runtime projects.
- Runtime stays NativeAOT/trim-safe: no runtime reflection, assembly scanning, runtime TOML,
  dynamic code, or unregistered Nerdbank shapes.
- No Vulkan/SDL types in `Bork2d.Api`; logging abstractions are the only external contract
  dependency.
- Pack format changes are versioned and documented in
  [Assets and tooling](architecture/assets-and-tooling.md).

## 6. Tests and CI

- Add unit tests with behavior changes; pack/format tests for asset changes; threading tests for
  handoff changes; GPU/visual tests for renderer changes.
- The dependency test and docs link check run in CI. The AOT publish smoke is a required local
  gate, not a CI job.
- GPU/validation checks need a Vulkan 1.3 runner from M8; headless/data tests must run without a
  GPU.
- Do not merge with disabled tests, flaky retries without a tracking entry, or a lowered warning
  level.

## 7. Documentation

- Update the owning document in the same change as a contract change; see the ownership table in
  [docs/README.md](README.md#ownership).
- Keep status markers accurate: `Current` only for implemented behavior; use `Partial`/`Planned`/
  `Open` honestly.
- Add a decision entry for public-contract or format changes.
- Update the roadmap progress log when a milestone lands.
- Run `pwsh scripts/check-docs.ps1` after moving headings or files.

## 8. Pull-request checklist

- [ ] `dotnet build` Debug and Release: zero warnings.
- [ ] `dotnet test` passes.
- [ ] `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` and `scripts/check-docs.ps1` pass.
- [ ] Dependency matrix respected; no unintended public types.
- [ ] No runtime reflection/TOML/dynamic code.
- [ ] NativeAOT smoke publishes/runs when runtime-affecting.
- [ ] Pack format/version updated if assets changed.
- [ ] Owning docs/API/decision log updated; status markers honest.
- [ ] No unjustified suppressions.
